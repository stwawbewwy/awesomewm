# Hello!
It seems that you have stumbled upon my personal config files.
If you're interested at all, you can use it I guess.

Credit to [@lcpz](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) and [@streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets) for their awesome widgets.

And of course a huge thanks to my second favourite twitch streamer [@chiffa](https://twitch.tv/ch1ffaa) for leading me down this rabbit hole. (Check em out they're cool)
