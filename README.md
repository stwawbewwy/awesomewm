# Hello!
It seems that you have stumbled upon my personal config files.  
If you're interested at all, you can use it I guess.

Credit to [@lcpz](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) and [@streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets) for their awesome widgets.  

And of course a huge thanks to my second favourite twitch streamer [@chiffa](https://twitch.tv/ch1ffaa) for leading me down this rabbit hole. (Check em out they're cool)

## Whoa! Hold on there buckaroo!
You may have noticed that I have a "autorun.sh" mentioned in my awesomewm config file. Edit it as you see fit. I use it instead of awful.spawn to make it easier for me to manage it.  
Also if the logout popup menu misses out some icons, that's cause it requires [awesome buttons](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-buttons.git). Clone it under ~/.config/awesome!  
Same goes with the cmus widget, it requires [arc icon theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme). Except you just need to follow the installation guide.
